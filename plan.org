* Process
** Using desktop components
1. First cut can be done without any battery integration. Just mains power -> 24V for pico psu -> MOBO, CPU and SSD
   - This will allow us to determine the power consumption of the system, at idle and under load, which will firstly dictate whether this is even possible by battery, and then what kind of batteies will suffice
2. Once this is done, the next step is to work out how everything will fit, and order the remaining components
   1. cad model of known components and mounts


** Raspberry Pi


* Power system
** Commercial
Detect required power first, then contact battery world

** Homemade system
- 18650 LiPo batteries are the best
  - Comes with solder tabs pre-attached for [[https://core-electronics.com.au/polymer-lithium-ion-battery-18650-cell-2600mah-solder-tab.html][$12.10 each]]
