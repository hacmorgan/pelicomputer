* Process
** Using desktop components
1. First cut can be done without any battery integration. Just mains power -> 24V for pico psu -> MOBO, CPU and SSD
   - This will allow us to determine the power consumption of the system, at idle and under load, which will firstly dictate whether this is even possible by battery, and then what kind of batteies will suffice
2. Once this is done, the next step is to work out how everything will fit, and order the remaining components
   1. cad model of known components and mounts


** Raspberry Pi


* Power system
** Commercial
Detect required power first, then contact battery world

** Homemade system
- 18650 LiPo batteries are the best

- Comes with solder tabs pre-attached for [[https://core-electronics.com.au/polymer-lithium-ion-battery-18650-cell-2600mah-solder-tab.html][$12.10 each]] from Core electronics -> 300 cycles to 80% discharge. 
  - There *are* more expensive options available, but considering this will be the first battery I've built, cheapies will be good.

- We must make the number of batteries in series enough that they won'd drop below the UBEC's minimum voltage (8V) and can't go above its max voltage (42V)
  - Min accetable cells: 2.7
  - Max acceptable cells: 10.0
  - For a safety barrier we should chose *no more than 9*
  - Order some spares
  - Make sure there are enough spacers  

- Probably need to buy a benchtop power supply, could maybe use Abyss's one. The strength of this will affect how many cells can be used.

*** Physical size
- the 1x2 one shown above has approximate size 40 x 20 x 8mm,
- one cell 20 x 20 x 65mm. 
- the full bock of cells would be 140 x 60 * 65
  - This fits well within the bounds of the case

*** Capacity
- = 21 cells
  - = 54.6Ah battery
  
- RPi power consumption
  - 3.4w at idle
  - 7.6w under load
  - Let's assume that average is halfway between these two: *5.5w*
	- We will designate these three values {3.4 *5.5* 7.6}w
  - At 5V power supply, that's {0.68 *1.1* 1.5}A
  - So for a 54.6Ah battery that's {80.3 *49* 36.4}h run time

*** Charging
With a number of cells in parallel, you must multiply current by the number in parallel. Suppose we have a power supply that can deliver 30V at 3.0A:
- no more than 3 in parallel to charge at < 3A
- No more than 7 in series to charge at 4.2V
